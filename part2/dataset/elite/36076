James Jordan’s takes ANOTHER pop at Celebrity Big Brother’s Jamie O’Hara and hints that he’s fake and his relationship with Bianca Gascoigne is a showmance   The dancer vents against his former housemate AGAIN JAMES Jordan has had ANOTHER pop at his former Celebrity Big Brother housemate Jamie O'Hara. Taking to Twitter AGAIN, the dancer has hinted he thinks that the footballer's relationship with Bianca Gascoigne isn't real. After Bianca was saved from eviction tonight, James tweeted: "Jamie will get even closer to Bianca now he knows she's one of the most popular  I can even c him trying to stand up to Speidi if they stay (sic)"   This is the second time Jame has poked fun at Jamie O'Hara, after the footballer confessed earlier in the week he wasn't looking for love until he met Bianca. He was quick to point out on Twitter that when he first got into the house he fancied  Jasmine Waltz  and  Nicola McLean . His comments come after  Jamie fled to the Diary Room to confess how he felt about Bianca  following revelations that she had a boyfriend on Wednesday night. In the final scene of the show the pair were seen in bed having a heart to heart about the situation. Jamie  looked increasing uncomfortable and made his excuses to get out of the bed saying he "needed some air". He then headed for the Diary Room where he confessed the situation had left him "hurting", his "head spinning" and he was "torn" about what to do. He also claimed that he "wasn't looking for love". Always on the wind up, James quickly went on Twitter to poke fun at his words saying: "😂😂😂 'I haven't come on here to crack on with a bird' 🐦 No mate, just Jasmine then Nicola then Bianca and said you fancied Jessica 🙈" He then added: "That's funny s***..... I love Bianca she is so lovely but she was his 3rd choice in the house 😂😂😂 He was looking for a romance. FACT!#CBB" Over the last week  Bianca and Jamie have been getting increasing close, and have even said "I love you"  - despite him finding out she has a boyfriend. Got a story?
