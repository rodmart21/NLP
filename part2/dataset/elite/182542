5 celebrities who became fathers again at a late age what do mick jagger , ronnie wood and clint eastwood have in common ? not only that they love women , but also that they became fathers again at a late age . Mick Jagger already has 7 children and his girlfriend is currently pregnant . At 73 years old, it doesn't seem to matter at all to him that he has long since reached retirement age. but it was not only mick jagger who decided late in life to start having children again . for example, there are four other men who are working on expanding their family with a much younger woman and what stands out? a few of them are rockers. hmm , they have no problems at all with the fact that they are in the poopy diapers again at this age . in fact , this is how they experience their second childhood ( or their third ) again . the children keeps them young !
